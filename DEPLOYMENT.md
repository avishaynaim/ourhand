# Deployment Guide

## Railway Deployment

Railway is a modern platform for deploying applications with zero configuration. Follow these steps to deploy Yad2 Monitor to Railway.

### Prerequisites

1. [Railway Account](https://railway.app/) (free tier available)
2. Railway CLI installed (optional, for CLI deployment)
3. GitHub repository with your code

### Method 1: Deploy via Railway Dashboard (Recommended)

#### Step 1: Create New Project

1. Go to [Railway Dashboard](https://railway.app/dashboard)
2. Click "New Project"
3. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. Authorize Railway to access your GitHub account
5. Select the `avishaynaim/Myhand` repository

#### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

In the Railway dashboard, go to your project's Variables tab and add:

**Required Variables:**
```
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token_from_botfather
API_KEY=your_generated_api_key
FLASK_ENV=production
```

**Important Variables:**
```
TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-app.up.railway.app
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=your_telegram_chat_id
```

**Optional Variables:**
```
YAD2_URL=https://www.yad2.co.il/realestate/rent?topArea=41&area=12&city=8400
MIN_INTERVAL_MINUTES=60
MAX_INTERVAL_MINUTES=90
ENABLE_WEB=true
WEB_PORT=5000
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://your-app.up.railway.app
```

#### Step 3: Get Your Railway App URL

1. After deployment, Railway will assign you a URL like `https://your-app.up.railway.app`
2. Copy this URL
3. Update the `TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_URL` variable with this URL

#### Step 4: Set Telegram Webhook

Once your app is deployed, set the Telegram webhook:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>/setWebhook" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url": "https://your-app.up.railway.app/telegram/webhook"}'
```

Replace:
- `<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>` with your actual bot token
- `your-app.up.railway.app` with your Railway app URL

#### Step 5: Verify Deployment

1. Check deployment logs in Railway dashboard
2. Visit `https://your-app.up.railway.app/health` to verify the app is running
3. Send `/start` to your Telegram bot to test

### Method 2: Deploy via Railway CLI

#### Step 1: Install Railway CLI

```bash
npm install -g @railway/cli
```

#### Step 2: Login to Railway

```bash
railway login
```

#### Step 3: Initialize Project

```bash
cd Myhand
railway init
```

#### Step 4: Add Environment Variables

```bash
railway variables set TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_token_here
railway variables set API_KEY=your_api_key_here
railway variables set TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-app.up.railway.app
```

#### Step 5: Deploy

```bash
railway up
```

#### Step 6: Get App URL

```bash
railway domain
```

Copy the URL and update `TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_URL`:

```bash
railway variables set TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-actual-url.up.railway.app
```

#### Step 7: Set Telegram Webhook

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>/setWebhook" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url": "https://your-actual-url.up.railway.app/telegram/webhook"}'
```

### Method 3: Deploy from CLI (One Command)

```bash
railway up
```

This will automatically:
- Detect it's a Python project
- Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`
- Run the start command from `Procfile`

### Generating API Key

Generate a secure API key using OpenSSL:

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
```

Or Python:

```python
import secrets
print(secrets.token_hex(32))
```

### Database Considerations

**For Production:**

Railway offers a free PostgreSQL database. To use PostgreSQL instead of SQLite:

1. In Railway dashboard, click "New" → "Database" → "PostgreSQL"
2. Railway will add a `DATABASE_URL` environment variable
3. Modify `database.py` to use PostgreSQL connection when `DATABASE_URL` is set

**For Development/Small Scale:**

The default SQLite database works fine for small to medium scale deployments.

### Monitoring & Logs

**View Logs:**
```bash
railway logs
```

**Monitor Resource Usage:**
- Go to Railway dashboard → Your Project → Metrics

### Updating the Deployment

**Via Git:**
1. Push changes to GitHub
2. Railway auto-deploys on every push to `main` branch

**Via CLI:**
```bash
railway up
```

### Troubleshooting

#### App Not Starting

Check logs:
```bash
railway logs
```

Common issues:
- Missing environment variables
- Port configuration (Railway assigns `PORT` env var automatically)
- Database connection errors

#### Telegram Bot Not Responding

1. Verify webhook is set:
```bash
curl "https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>/getWebhookInfo"
```

2. Check webhook URL is correct
3. Verify app is accessible at the webhook URL
4. Check Railway logs for errors

#### Database Locked Errors

If using SQLite with high traffic:
1. Consider switching to PostgreSQL
2. Increase `busy_timeout` in database.py
3. Enable WAL mode (already enabled)

### Custom Domain (Optional)

1. Go to Railway dashboard → Settings → Domains
2. Click "Add Custom Domain"
3. Follow instructions to configure DNS

### Cost Estimates

Railway Free Tier:
- $5 worth of usage per month
- Enough for small projects
- Automatically scales to zero when not in use

Pro Plan:
- $20/month base
- Usage-based pricing beyond included credits

### Security Checklist

- ✅ API key is set and secure (32+ character random string)
- ✅ ALLOWED_ORIGINS is set to specific domain (not `*`)
- ✅ Environment variables are not hardcoded in code
- ✅ `.env` file is in `.gitignore`
- ✅ Telegram webhook uses HTTPS
- ✅ Database file permissions are secure

### Next Steps

1. Set up monitoring/alerting
2. Configure backup strategy for database
3. Set up custom domain
4. Configure rate limiting appropriately
5. Monitor resource usage and optimize as needed

## Alternative Deployments

### Docker Deployment

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

Build and run:
```bash
docker build -t yad2-monitor .
docker run -p 5000:5000 --env-file .env yad2-monitor
```

### Heroku Deployment

1. Create `runtime.txt`:
```
python-3.9.18
```

2. Deploy:
```bash
heroku create yad2-monitor
heroku config:set TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_token
heroku config:set API_KEY=your_key
git push heroku main
```

### VPS Deployment

1. SSH into your server
2. Clone repository
3. Install dependencies
4. Set up systemd service
5. Configure nginx reverse proxy
6. Set up SSL with Let's Encrypt
